## THIS BREAKS ATERNOS' TOS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ##

# ATERNOS DISCORD BOT
Control over your Aternos server all with a simple Discord Bot.

The Bot is getting an update so that it works despite Aternos' retarded decisions such as deliberately breaking *most* of the Python-Aternos API. There are only a few commands that still work, so ig that makes the bot worth updating one last time.

*12/07/24 Changelog:*
+ Added Slash Commands
+ Removed useless commands as they no longer work
+ Optimized code
+ Role Permissions added
+ & more

Credits to Python-Aternos (https://pypi.org/project/python-aternos/) for the API itself.

## Requirements

*The bot uses 4 libraries: Discord, Asyncio, & Python-Aternos so make sure you have them installed via pip.*

## Commands list

/start Pretty self explanatory.

/stop Pretty self explanatory.

/info Shows information about your server. 

/whitelisted Shows people that are whitelisted. 

/bans Show's the ban list. 

The update was written in like an hour, so it might have some bugs.
